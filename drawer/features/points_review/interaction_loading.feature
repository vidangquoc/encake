Feature: Points review
  In order to memorize what I've learned
  As an english learner
  I want to review learning points
  
  #@dev
  #Scenario: show loading indicator when sound files are being loaded  
  #  When I get 10 points for review
  #  Then I see loading indicator when my data is being loaded
  #  And I don't see loading indicator when my data is fully loaded
