The goals of your site introduction are:

    To let the visitor know, as quickly as possible, what the website is about.
    To give hints as to what action (or actions) they can take immediately (call to action).
    To provide contextual information regarding what to expect should the visitor decide to spend more time on the site.

    + People rarely read Web pages word by word; instead, they scan the page, picking out individual words and sentences.
    
    + Web users are busy: they want to get the straight facts.
    
    + Using succinct copy, placing the intro text in a highly visible position, using common typographic styling and leveraging surrounding visuals to your advantage are among the popular trends used in todayâ€™s site introductory text.
