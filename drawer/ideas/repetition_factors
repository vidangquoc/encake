Repetition factors should
1. Keep retention rate high
2. But still let learners advance with high speed

+ Calculate total repeating times across all skills
+ Specify repetition factors

Idias:

- Create translating skill only for points with short examples (less than 10 words)
- Custom values for repitition factors
- Private point -> show previous example

- Number of times a word being reviewed in 1 year for values of repetition factors

  + spelling, pronouncing: 2.5, translating: 3.5, listening: 2.5)
	
	+ equation: due_date = today + spacing_factor**(effectively_reviewed_times)) days

  7(with spelling) + 7(with pronouncing) + 5x7(with translating) + 5x5(with listening) = 55
